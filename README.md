# Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex (PS2) Decompilation

Binary name: `SLUS_202.38`

## Disclaimer
This decompilation is in very early stages and will fail to build. This document
will be updated to provide build instructions when the time comes.

## I want to contribute. What can I do to help?
You will need Ghidra, preferably the latest version, available [here](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra). You also need the following extension, which adds support for the PS2's CPU, which is available [here](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ghidra-emotionengine-reloaded).

Then, you can import the game's executable and find a function that hasn't been reversed yet, reverse it, and make a pull request with your changes.
